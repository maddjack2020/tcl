 Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the
 information needed to do the operation requested by the code that
 indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another
 table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether
 the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or
 distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table
 pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of
 that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op
 is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is
 the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off
 of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case
 of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from
 the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes.

Copyright: 2004-2019 Mark Adler, For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in gzlog.h version 2.3, 25 May 2019
License:   __HEADER___
 gzlog provides a mechanism for frequently appending short strings to a gzip
 file that is efficient both in execution time and compression ratio.  The
 strategy is to write the short strings in an uncompressed form to the end of
 the gzip file, only compressing when the amount of uncompressed data has
 reached a given threshold.
 .
 gzlog also provides protection against interruptions in the process due to
 system crashes.  The status of the operation is recorded in an extra field
 in the gzip file, and is only updated once the gzip file is brought to a
 valid state.  The last data to be appended or compressed is saved in an
 auxiliary file, so that if the operation is interrupted, it can be completed
 the next time an append operation is attempted.
 .
 gzlog maintains another auxiliary file with the last 32K of data from the
 compressed portion, which is preloaded for the compression of the subsequent
 data.  This minimizes the impact to the compression ratio of appending.
 .
 Operations Concept:
 .
 Files (log name "foo"):
 foo.gz -- gzip file with the complete log
 foo.add -- last message to append or last data to compress
 foo.dict -- dictionary of the last 32K of data for next compression
 foo.temp -- temporary dictionary file for compression after this one
 foo.lock -- lock file for reading and writing the other files
 foo.repairs -- log file for log file recovery operations (not compressed)
 .
 gzip file structure:
 - fixed-length (no file name) header with extra field (see below)
 - compressed data ending initially with empty stored block
 - uncompressed data filling out originally empty stored block and
 subsequent stored blocks as needed (16K max each)
 - gzip trailer
 - no junk at end (no other gzip streams)
 .
 When appending data, the information in the first three items above plus the
 foo.add file are sufficient to recover an interrupted append operation.  The
 extra field has the necessary information to restore the start of the last
 stored block and determine where to append the data in the foo.add file, as
 well as the crc and length of the gzip data before the append operation.
 .
 The foo.add file is created before the gzip file is marked for append, and
 deleted after the gzip file is marked as complete.  So if the append
 operation is interrupted, the data to add will still be there.  If due to
 some external force, the foo.add file gets deleted between when the append
 operation was interrupted and when recovery is attempted, the gzip file will
 still be restored, but without the appended data.
 .
 When compressing data, the information in the first two items above plus the
 foo.add file are sufficient to recover an interrupted compress operation.
 The extra field has the necessary information to find the end of the
 compressed data, and contains both the crc and length of just the compressed
 data and of the complete set of data including the contents of the foo.add
 file.
 .
 Again, the foo.add file is maintained during the compress operation in case
 of an interruption.  If in the unlikely event the foo.add file with the data
 to be compressed is missing due to some external force, a gzip file with
 just the previous compressed data will be reconstructed.  In this case, all
 of the data that was to be compressed is lost (approximately one megabyte).
 This will not occur if all that happened was an interruption of the compress
 operation.
 .
 The third state that is marked is the replacement of the old dictionary with
 the new dictionary after a compress operation.  Once compression is
 complete, the gzip file is marked as being in the replace state.  This
 completes the gzip file, so an interrupt after being so marked does not
 result in recompression.  Then the dictionary file is replaced, and the gzip
 file is marked as completed.  This state prevents the possibility of
 restarting compression with the wrong dictionary file.
 .
 All three operations are wrapped by a lock/unlock procedure.  In order to
 gain exclusive access to the log files, first a foo.lock file must be
 exclusively created.  When all operations are complete, the lock is
 released by deleting the foo.lock file.  If when attempting to create the
 lock file, it already exists and the modify time of the lock file is more
 than five minutes old (set by the PATIENCE define below), then the old
 lock file is considered stale and deleted, and the exclusive creation of
 the lock file is retried.  To assure that there are no false assessments
 of the staleness of the lock file, the operations periodically touch the
 lock file to update the modified date.
 .
 Following is the definition of the extra field with all of the information
 required to enable the above append and compress operations and their
 recovery if interrupted.  Multi-byte values are stored little endian
 (consistent with the gzip format).  File pointers are eight bytes long.
 The crc's and lengths for the gzip trailer are four bytes long.  (Note that
 the length at the end of a gzip file is used for error checking only, and
 for large files is actually the length modulo 2^32.)  The stored block
 length is two bytes long.  The gzip extra field two-byte identification is
 "ap" for append.  It is assumed that writing the extra field to the file is
 an "atomic" operation.  That is, either all of the extra field is written
 to the file, or none of it is, if the operation is interrupted right at the
 point of updating the extra field.  This is a reasonable assumption, since
 the extra field is within the first 52 bytes of the file, which is smaller
 than any expected block size for a mass storage device (usually 512 bytes or
 larger).
 .
 Extra field (35 bytes):
 - Pointer to first stored block length -- this points to the two-byte length
 of the first stored block, which is followed by the two-byte, one's
 complement of that length.  The stored block length is preceded by the
 three-bit header of the stored block, which is the actual start of the
 stored block in the deflate format.  See the bit offset field below.
 - Pointer to the last stored block length.  This is the same as above, but
 for the last stored block of the uncompressed data in the gzip file.
 Initially this is the same as the first stored block length pointer.

 minigzip is a minimal implementation of the gzip utility. This is
 only an example of using zlib and isn't meant to replace the
 full-featured gzip. No attempt is made to deal with file systems
 limiting names to 14 or 8+3 characters, etc... Error checking is
 very limited. So use minigzip only for testing; use gzip for the
 real thing. On MSDOS, use only on file names without extension
 or in pipe mode.

 puff.c is a simple inflate written to be an unambiguous way to specify the
 deflate format.  It is not written for speed but rather simplicity.  As a
 side benefit, this code might actually be useful when small code is more
 important than speed, such as bootstrap applications.  For typical deflate
 data, zlib's inflate() is about four times as fast as puff().  zlib's
 inflate compiles to around 20K on my machine, whereas puff.c compiles to
 around 4K on my machine (a PowerPC using GNU cc).  If the faster decode()
 function here is used, then puff() is only twice as slow as zlib's
 inflate().
 .
 All dynamically allocated memory comes from the stack.  The stack required
 is less than 2K bytes.  This code is compatible with 16-bit int's and
 assumes that long's are at least 32 bits.  puff.c uses the short data type,
 assumed to be 16 bits, for arrays in order to conserve memory.  The code
 works whether integers are stored big endian or little endian.
 .
 In the comments below are "Format notes" that describe the inflate process
 and document some of the less obvious aspects of the format.  This source
 code is meant to supplement RFC 1951, which formally describes the deflate
 format:

 Make sure that both EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are defined. This does not
 compile on systems where neither is defined. We want both defined so that
 we can test safely for both. In the code we still have to test for both
 because there may be systems on which both are defined and have different
 values.

 You might think that this could be incorporated into regcomp.c, and that
 would be a reasonable idea... except that this is a generic function (with
 a generic name), applicable to all compiled REs regardless of the size of
 their characters, whereas the stuff in regcomp.c gets compiled once per
 character size.

 with multithreading support.
 --disable-load		If this switch is specified then Tcl will
 configure itself not to allow dynamic loading,

 Normally you can leave this switch out and Tcl
 will build itself for dynamic loading if your
 system supports it.
 --disable-dll-unloading	Disables support for the [unload] command even
 on platforms that can support it. Meaningless
 when Tcl is compiled with --disable-load.
 --enable-shared		If this switch is specified, Tcl will compile
 itself as a shared library if it can figure
 out how to do that on this platform. This is
 the default on platforms where we know how to
 build shared libraries.
 --disable-shared	If this switch is specified, Tcl will compile
 itself as a static library.

 standard debugging symbols are used. You can

 This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
 .
 The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
 non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
 whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
 (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
 .
 This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
 Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
 file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
 version without encryption capabilities).

 If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols

 blast.c decompresses data compressed by the PKWare Compression Library.
 This function provides functionality similar to the explode() function of
 the PKWare library, hence the name "blast".
 .
 This decompressor is based on the excellent format description provided by
 Ben Rudiak-Gould in comp.compression on August 13, 2001.  Interestingly, the
 example Ben provided in the post is incorrect.  The distance 110001 should
 instead be 111000.  When corrected, the example byte stream becomes:
 .
 00 04 82 24 25 8f 80 7f
 .
 which decompresses to "AIAIAIAIAIAIA" (without the quotes).
 .
 Change history:
 .
 1.0  12 Feb 2003     - First version
 1.1  16 Feb 2003     - Fixed distance check for > 4 GB uncompressed data
 1.2  24 Oct 2012     - Add note about using binary mode in stdio
 - Fix comparisons of differently signed integers
 1.3  24 Aug 2013     - Return unused input from blast()
 - Fix test code to correctly report unused input

 gznorm takes a gzip stream, potentially containing multiple members, and
 converts it to a gzip stream with a single member. In addition the gzip
 header is normalized, removing the file name and time stamp, and setting the
 other header contents (XFL, OS) to fixed values. gznorm does not recompress
 the data, so it is fast, but no advantage is gained from the history that
 could be available across member boundaries.

 The following structure is the internal rep for a String object. It keeps
 track of how much memory has been used and how much has been allocated for
 the Unicode and UTF string to enable growing and shrinking of the UTF and
 Unicode reps of the String object with fewer mallocs. To optimize string
 length and indexing operations, this structure also stores the number of
 characters (same of UTF and Unicode!) once that value has been computed.
 .
 Under normal configurations, what Tcl calls "Unicode" is actually UTF-16
 restricted to the Basic Multilingual Plane (i.e. U+00000 to U+0FFFF). This

 blast() decompresses the PKWare Data Compression Library (DCL) compressed
 format.  It provides the same functionality as the explode() function in
 that library.  (Note: PKWare overused the "implode" verb, and the format
 used by their library implode() function is completely different and
 incompatible with the implode compression method supported by PKZIP.)
 .
 The binary mode for stdio functions should be used to assure that the
 compressed data is not corrupted when read or written.  For example:
 fopen(..., "rb") and fopen(..., "wb").

 ALGORITHM
 .
 The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 .
 The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 (by Leonid Broukhis).
 A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
